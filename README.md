# FDR Flight Recorder #

FDR Flight Recorder records real flights to be played back in the X-Plane flight simulator or to be viewed on the device. The flight is recorded using the gyroscope and GPS units in the phone, with the phone oriented forward and flat for flight. The attitude and location of the flight will be recorded every few seconds, which will allow the entire flight to be tracked. The flight files can then be stored on the device and emailed for viewing in X-Plane or a similar FDR flight viewer.
